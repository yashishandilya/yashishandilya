### I am Yashi / ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•Ä. My name is pronounced as yu(h)-shi / /j å  Éi/, and I love thinking about thinking.

Human and artificial intelligence has fascinated me for as long as I can remember, leading me to switch my career from being a Neuroscience major on track for Med School to Computer Science! In my spare time, I love reading, writing, adding things to my endless Pinterest boards, taking long walks, and cleaning things that were already clean. 

### What I have worked on outside my university curriculum:
<p>**Currently Learning**: Developed a Pinterest clone using the MERN stack, currently adding a new feature involving pins recommended using Sanzo Wada color palettes<br>
**Currently Reading**: 'Darwin's Backyard' by James T. Costa and 'The Worlds I See' by Dr. Fei-Fei Li<br><br>
My all-time favorite book recommendation is 'Prisoners of Geography' by Tim Marshall.</p>

### Me, at the Association for Computing Machinery at University of Illinois Chicago
President, for the second year in a row. I have founded and led 2 Special Interest Groups in Algorithms and AI, respectively. Through my weekly project-based and lecture-based meetings, I am trying to bridge the gap in resources in Technical Interview Prep and AI at my university.

### My hopes in the current job market:
I am interested in Full-Stack Development and AI/ML roles. ACM at UIC is my current full-time hobby. The best way to reach me is through email!

### TECHNICAL SKILLS:
<p>**Programming Languages:** JavaScript, Java, Python, SQL, C/C++, HTML, CSS<br>
**Platforms & Developer Tools:** Linux, Windows, Git, Postman, MongoDB, Maven, Pytorch, Docker<br>
**Libraries & Frameworks:** Node.js, React.js, Express.js, Sckit-learn, REST, MySQL, JUnit, FXML</p>
