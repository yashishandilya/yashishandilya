### I am Yashi / ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•Ä. My name is pronounced as yu(h)-shi / /j å  Éi/, and I love thinking about thinking.

Human and artificial intelligence has fascinated me for as long as I can remember, leading me to switch my career from being a Neuroscience major on track for Med School to Computer Science! 
Through my efforts in leading a Special Interest Group for LeetCode workshops and AI, I am trying to bridge the gap in resources in Technical Interview Prep and AI at my university.

In my spare time, I love reading, writing, adding things to my endless Pinterest boards, taking long walks, and cleaning things that were already clean. 
My all-time favorite book recommendation is 'Prisoners of Geography' by Tim Marshall. 

Currently Learning: Developed a Pinterest clone using the MERN stack, currently adding a new feature involving pins recommended using Sanzo Wada color palettes
Currently Reading: 'Darwin's Backyard' by James T. Costa and 'The Worlds I See' by Dr. Fei-Fei Li

I am interested in Full-Stack Development and AI/ML roles. ACM at UIC is my current full-time hobby. The best way to reach me is through email!
